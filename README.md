# Command Terminal Interface - Personal Project

This is a simple web-based command terminal interface, where you can input commands and see a simulated loading bar while executing them. The interface processes predefined commands and displays corresponding information, such as an "About" section, "Projects" list, and contact details. Itâ€™s a fun little personal project to showcase a simulated command line environment with some interactive features.

## Features

- **Interactive Commands**: Enter commands like `help`, `about`, `projects`, and `contact` to retrieve specific information.
- **Progress Bar**: The progress bar shows random loading times between 1.5s and 3s, adding a natural feel to the command execution.
- **Customizable Output**: The commands are customizable, and you can easily extend the list of commands or modify the content.

## Commands

- `help`: Displays available commands.
- `about`: Shows information about this project.
- `projects`: Lists projects and provides links to them.
- `contact`: Displays contact information.
- `clear`: Clears the terminal window.
